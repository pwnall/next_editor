NextEditor is a lightweight syntax-highlighting editor that works on all current
browsers, and handles IMEs (non-latin character input) and touchscreens
gracefully. The code is used in production at http://nextlang.com.

NextEditor does not subscribe to the latest trend of re-implementing the input
field UI by using a canvas element, because this method does not work well for
IMEs, at the current time. Instead, NextEditor's input is backed by elements
that are traditionally used for input. NextEditor implements syntax highlighting
by tagging spans with classes, so it can use any highlighting style that can be
expressed in CSS. 

On modern browsers, NextEditor uses the HTML5 contentEditable attribute for rich
text inputs, and re-formats the DOM inside the editor on every change. This
allows full flexibility in the syntax highlighting CSS. On older browsers, a div
is overlaid right on top of a textarea, so the syntax highlighting CSS cannot
change the width of characters. For example, the highlighting spans must have
padding-left and padding-right set to 0, and the same font-family and font-size
as un-highlighted text.
